# Sample Project to showcase Scala
##### Mahesh Parab and Hima Boddupalli

This repo contains a set of Scala classes that showcase various Scala
features. We have implement a similar example of different types of ducks
with different behaviors as shown in the lectures. Important lines of code
have been annotated with appropriate comments. The complete list of features
shown in the code is given below:

- Different types of expressions - Values, variables, blocks and functions
- Functions and methods
- Class definition and instantiation
- Singleton objects / Companion objects
- Traits / Mixins
- Case classes and pattern matching
- Named parameters
